# core-yield

A `Yield` is a key element in Civilization and can refer to anything from the `Attack` value of a `Unit` to, the `Food` returned for a `Tile` or the `Unhappiness` produced by a `City`.

An instance of a `Yield` maintains a history of `YieldValue`s, each of which may have a `provider` of what caused the value to change.
